# Khnum
This is my high-performance metabolomics software for 13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis. The problem is computationally expensive, which is why it is challenging to develop an optimal fast algorithm. I developed it as my thesis on bachelor's degree at MSU Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics. 
# Does it work?
Technically, yes. But it has no UI and documentation. I used too much C++ instead of python, and this is the problem. At the moment, I have no incentives to keep working on it, but I hope to meet metabolic biologists, partly rewrite code to python and release it one day.
